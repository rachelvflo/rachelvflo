  👋 Hi, I’m @rachelvflo

- I joined GitHub in March of 2022. I work in Design Operations as an Executive Assistant.
- I live in Sunny Arizona, where the summers are brutal 🥵 and the winters are dreamy ☀️
- Outside of work I enjoy staying active 🏃‍♀️, hanging with my two big dogs 🦮, and dabbling in interior design 🛋.
